HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
It is the standard language used to create webpages.
HTML tells the web browser how to display text, images, links, and other content on a webpage.

History of HTML

Created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 while working at CERN (a research center in Switzerland).

The first version (HTML 1.0) was very simple, allowing only basic webpage structure.

Later versions improved it:

HTML 2.0 (1995): Introduced forms and tables.

HTML 3.2 (1997): Added more formatting and scripting features.

HTML 4.0 (1999): Became widely used for years.

HTML5 (2014): Current version — supports audio, video, canvas, and responsive design.
